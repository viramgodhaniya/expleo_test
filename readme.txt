Setup the the Solution: Unzip the file  into any location in the computer. Now using the IDE import the maven Project into the work space. Build the solution from within the IDE and maven will automatically download the required java dependencies.

Running the Test cases: Corresponding Tag has been provided to the feature file in order to run it. The test here can be executed using the tag @currencyConvCheck. Inorder to run the test case, goto Acceptance test class present under '/src/main/java/testRunner/AcceptanceTest.java'. Provide the tag name under tags field and run the AcceptanceTest Class as junit. Wait for Test Execution to be completed (approx 5 mins).

Analyzing the Test Results with help of Extent Reports: An extent Report will be generated at '/target/cucumber-reports/report.html' inside the project folder after the test run is completed. Open the report into a web browser (Chrome is highly recomended for better results). Each and every scenario has been detiled in the report, each step being the gherkin line of the feature file and gherkin step lines are having the description of exactly what was tested within a gherkin wherever required. A Dashboard view having entire test summary can also be found in the report by clicking on small circular icon present on the left hand side pane. A sample report is already present in the '/target/cucumber-reports/' folder of the current solution.
